    <h1>PBX Hardware</h1>
<p>This device is comprised of off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts.<br></p>
<p>This device is meant to replace a keyboard for gaming. It was designed to feel more like a handheld controller than a keyboard, to cause less strain on the hand and wrist, and to make it easier to find the function or action you're looking for.<br></p>
    <p>These are the early stages of documenting and releasing information about the project to the public.</p>
    <p>I welcome any help from contributors with a positive frame of mind who want to help the project along.</p>
    <p>I realize that these documents seem incomplete and not of the best quality but I will endeavor to improve and complete the project over time.</p>
 <p>Overall cost of the project is around $70.00.</p>
